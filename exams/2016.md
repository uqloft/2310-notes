b. `cut -d ' ' -f 1 elephant | grep mouse | wc -l`

## Question 4

### Question 4.a
From i to iv:  820085, 820085, 827392, 827391.

### Question 4.b
From i to iv: 2, 2, 2, 0. **CHECK THIS**

### Question 4.c

Page 0 is mapped which means NULL can be 'correctly' dereferenced. Coventionally, page 0 is unmapped so dereferencing null leads to a segfault, helping debugging.

Pages 24 and 27 map to the same frame. Modifying one modifies the other. This limits memory usefully usable by the process.

## Question 5

### Question 5.a
Library has 60 immediate subdirectories. An empty directory has link count of 2 (itself and the . reference). Every subdirectory adds one link count from its `..` reference.

### Question 5.b
4KB, because v.sh and v2.sh are distinct files with link count 2. Block size of 1KB means each 1.6KB file takes up 2 blocks = 2KB. Deleting them lets us create a file of size 4KB.

### Quesiton 5.c

i. fjord is itself unchanged; it still points to python3. However, python3 now has the contents of perl, as it shares an inode with perl.

ii. Symbolic link is broken as there is no longer a file with the name parrot.

iii. Perl is unchanged. Link count increases by 1 from `ln` but decreases by 1 again after `rm parrot`.

iv. Now shares an inode with perl and parrot. Link count is 3.

### Question 5.d
Executing files as the owner requires `u+x` permissions on the containing directory; we would need `u+x` bit set on `WINDOWS/SYSTEM32`.

## Question 6
### Question 6.a

i. We fill in the table with the smallest possible networks. That is, the networks with the smallest number of host bits possible.

-----------------
| Network | Broadcast address | Netmask | Unused addresses |
-------------------------
| A | 10.0.15.255 | 255.255.250.0 | 4090 |
| B | 10.1.15.255 | 255.255.255.192 | 
| C | 10.0.127.127 | 255.255.255.128 | 122

ii. Link layer

iii. Transport layer.

iv. Network layer.

v. socket, bind, listen, accept

## Question 7

a. (11 + 1026 + 2(1024^2)) * 16 = 33570992 KiB

b. 

c. Same calculations as a. 4198488 KiB

d. Smaller blocks means less wasted space if blocks are frequently partially filled. This could happen if many files are small, < 16KB.

## Question 8

### Question 8.a
i. 15 **new** processes are created after running A.

ii. 7 will not be reaped??

iii. kill

### Question 8.b

2. fork
3. dup2
4. exec
5. dup2
6. exec
7. dup2
8. exec
9. pipe
10. pipe
11. fork
12. fork
13. dup2
14. exec


## Question 9

### Question 9.a

```c
int sumline(const char* line) {
  char* start = line;
  int sum = 0;
  while (1) {
    char* end;
    int num = strtol(start, &end, 10);
    sum += num; // num is 0 on error
    if (*end == ' ') {
      start = end + 1; // move past space
    } else {
      return sum; // break at \0 or first non-digit, non-space
    }
  }
}
```

### Question 9.b
```c
void sumfile(FILE* in, FILE* out) {
  while (1) {
    char line[100];
    if (fgets(line, 80, in) == NULL) break;
    fprintf(out, "%d\n", sumline(line));
  }
}
```

### Question 9.c
```c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // start past argv[0].
  for (int i = 01; i < argc; i++) {
    char* filename = argv[i];
    if (fork() == 0) { 
      // child
      char* outname = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(filename) + 5));
      sprintf(outname, "%s.out", filename);
      FILE* in = fopen(filename, "r");
      FILE* out = fopen(outname, "w");
      sumfile(in, out);
      fclose(in);
      fclose(out);
      free(outname);
      return 0; // exit from child
   }
  }
  return 0;
}
```
